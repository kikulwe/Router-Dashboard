#Router Dashboard

Router Dashboard is a web application that provides a user-friendly interface to monitor and manage your TP-Link router. It allows you to view various statistics and settings related to your router, including the number of connected devices, internet connection status, network performance, wireless network settings, and security settings.

Features
Dashboard Overview: Get a quick overview of your router's status, including the number of connected users, internet connection status, and other key metrics.

Connected Devices: View a list of devices currently connected to the router, along with their names, IP addresses, and MAC addresses. You can also see additional details such as device type, connection type (wired/wireless), and data usage.

Network Performance: Monitor real-time or historical data on the network's upload and download bandwidth usage using interactive graphs and charts. Check your current internet speed (upload and download) to ensure optimal network performance.

Wireless Network Settings: Easily manage your Wi-Fi network by changing the SSID and password for security purposes. If supported, enable or disable a guest network with its own credentials.

Wired Network Settings: Configure LAN settings, including IP addresses and DHCP options.

Security Settings: Enhance network security with options to configure firewall rules, manage access control lists (ACLs), and set up port forwarding for specific applications or services.
